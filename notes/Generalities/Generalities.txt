Game starts with main character waking up in her room aboard the generation colony ship Tomlinson.
As she leaves her room and begins moving around the ship, she discovers she is now the only human on the ship,
and has no clue what happened to anyone else on the ship. She begins exploring the entire ship, trying to find
out what caused this mass disappearance. 



2D side scroller
- dark atmosphere
- psychological horror
- NO ALIENS, NO REAL ENEMIES
- central conflict will revolve around isolation, sensory depravation, and insecurities
- sprawling map focused on vertical connectedness
- the story will be told through notes, very conseratively used character dialogue, and the ship itself


Planned features
- global timer that counts the time the player has been playing without activating a bed or using food/drink.
the only effect of "sleep deprivation" or dehydration is that as the global timer increases, the % chance
of audio/visual hallucinations occuring in game increases.
- hallucinations increase in intensity as global timer climbs until eventually the player succumbs to psycological
distress
